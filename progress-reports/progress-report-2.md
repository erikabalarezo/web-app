3.	Goals for this week  
	Be able to display accurate info for specific location/event depending on the date entered.

	Design a logo for the app.

	CSS coding.  
	
6.	What parts of the application, in the past, were frustrating?  
	Not having the concepts at my fingertips.
	
7.	Did you have to radically alter something you'd finished previously?
