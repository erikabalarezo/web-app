Progress Report 3
=================  


1. What features have you accomplished in the past week?
	-	Fix the problem of the date. Now it displays accurate information.
	-	Enter data in the database for all the categories.
	-	Display the data for all the categories.
	-	Applied more style.   
		
2.	Did you achieve the previous week's goals?  
	The date problem was fixed. I didn't design the logo because it was more important to update the info for all the categories and display it.  
	
3.	Goals for this week  
	Now that the data is accurate, I should add:
	-	Rating for all locations. Right now the rating option is for events only.
	-	Icon for each category.
	-	Style inside pages of locations/events.
			
4.	What concepts/techniques did you learn?  
	Getting more familiar with php. Practicing more CSS.	
	
5.	What parts of the application, in the past, were enjoyable?  
	I feel better understanding php.  
	
6.	What parts of the application, in the past, were frustrating?  
	Still learning php. I wrote some code that works and took a lot of time to get it working but in the end it was not efficient and therefore needed help to re-write it.
	
7.	Did you have to radically alter something you'd finished previously?  
	As I mentioned, just had to fix code which was not efficient.
