	<p>Your Word Is Bond explores the notion of giving your word to someone, of what it means to speak tender or fervent “truths” that are sincerely meant at one time but not for all time.</p>
    <p> The exhibition considers as well the nature of memory, correspondence and other talismans of the past. Composed of four inter-related works by Ottawa-based artist Christos Pantieras, each piece stands as a chronicle of a separate relationship, linked together via correspondence that lays it bare, from initial flirtations to parting words.</p>
